e:T414,
    I know
    this isn't real
    I can't believe my eyes
    but this is how I feel

    fallen angel
    thrown away its grace
    a child of darkness
    swallowed by the moon's embrace

    creeping shadows
    in the flickering light
    twinkle twinkle
    through this endless night

    and in my room
    I've put up all these walls
    I focus on the problems
    I never had at all

    and over here
    I wish I'd disappear
    from the world outside
    just leave it all behind
    and all my fear
    and all these missing tears
    that hide inside
    they'll just erase my mind

    I know
    the truth that is concealed
    a cloud upon a clear red sky
    the doors that hide the deal

    artificial monster
    that awakens from its cryostasis
    leaving nothing in its wake
    it torments only my disgraces

    and over here
    I wish I'd disappear
    from the world outside
    just leave it all behind
    and all my fear
    and all these missing tears
    that hide inside
    they'll just erase my mind
    f:T544,
    still water depression
    in a pond of possibilities
    stale grown relations
    and stagnant mobility

    a novel expression
    a blossoming burrough
    the hope of a warm breeze
    and the spring of tomorrow

    an obscured reflection
    of my self imposed projections
    an unhealthy obsession
    with a lunar possession

    sometimes when I'm feeling low
    I drift along the undertow
    flowing further down the stream
    I indulge in my fruitless dreams

    still water depression
    on the verge of drying out
    salted words, sweetened tears
    without reason, beyond doubt

    linear regression
    pretty clear but quite unknown
    instant gratification
    living free inside your phone

    an obscured reflection
    of my self imposed projections
    an unhealthy obsession
    with a lunar possession

    sometimes when I'm feeling low
    I drift along the undertow
    flowing further down the stream
    I indulge in my fruitless dreams

    still water depression
    in a pond of possibilities
    stale grown relations
    and stagnant mobility

    a novel expression
    a blossoming burrough
    the hope of a warm breeze
    and the spring of tomorrow

    sometimes when I'm feeling low
    I drift along the undertow
    flowing further down the stream
    I indulge in my fruitless dreams

1e:T635,
    she's got problems of her own
    she doesn't want to share
    her sky is empty, there's no sun
    although her chest lies bare

    she's got no way of knowing 
    the origin of her pain
    now her eyes are no longer glowing
    and her soul has been left stained

    she's not the only one 
    she's acting on her heart's desires
    while living just for fun
    she's worried that her heart's caught fire

    she holds her breath and waits
    she hopes that someone comes to save her
    someone that relates
    someone that can be her savior

    focused on her own true feelings
    she doesn't feel regret
    while loneliness can be appealing
    she won't ever forget

    the thoughts that once consumed her mind
    the fear of being left behind 
    the darkness growing deep inside her
    and the truth that she must find

    she's not the only one 
    she's acting on her heart's desires
    while living just for fun
    she's worried that her heart's caught fire

    she holds her breath and waits
    she hopes that someone comes to save her
    someone that relates
    someone she can call her savior

    the night she reached out to the stars
    the dream that used to seem so far
    the steps she used to thread with ease
    the moment of divine release

    she's not the only one 
    she's acting on her heart's desires
    while living just for fun
    she's worried that her heart's caught fire

    she holds her breath and waits
    she hopes that someone comes to save her
    someone that relates

1f:T5c6,
    the sunken ship, beneath the surface
    a relic of what used to be
    ensnared within this great solution
    a fragile droplet in the sea

    the sun king's ship lies still before us
    its luster gone, washed out in time
    this shadow hiding in the moonlight
    the gleaming hope that once was mine

    do you
    feel
    blue, like we used to
    and do you
    expect that something will change without action

    you preach of rebellion, yet savour the peace
    while your body is ailing, you spread the disease
    you slander your purpose, you sacrifice friends
    still you try to go back on your words over and over again

    the moonlit goddess has abandoned the sky
    she has left all she knew, and is wondering why
    all the birds have stopped singing, the trees dropped their leaves
    why sun doesn't rise at the dawn of the eve

    now the castle is empty, these dogs have no home
    could you give us some shelter, could you spare us some bones
    in this world where the people are ruled by the blind
    could you give us some faith, 
    could you spare us some eyes

    do you think
    we could be free
    from this strange
    melancholy
    do you think 
    something might change if I reach out and grab you

    oh, how we tremble, afraid of the fear
    or the warmth in my stomach whenever you're near
    do you think we should change, do you think that we could 
    or has the sun king's ship now departed for good

20:T4de,
    I don't want to be just a piece among the rest 
    struggling for tomorrow, when I have no interest
    I don't want to solve this puzzle, it will only bring me pain
    I wish I could have a vacuum in the space where there's a brain

    I don't want to be another sun among the stars
    but am I still allowed to dream, if I have no dreams at all 
    if I go to sleep tomorrow, will I wake up yesterday
    if I follow all the signs, can I still be led astray

    do you feel meaning in life
    you've been silently screaming, I know
    now the twilight of evening is here
    and the day has left you feeling so low

    I don't want to be just a piece among the rest
    but am I able to succeed without passing any tests
    I don't want to spend my time washing off these bloody stains
    living in an age where half the world has gone insane

    I don't want to be another sun among the stars
    asking for forgiveness once the joke has gone too far
    passing out from work by the middle of the day
    and then passing out again at home, I dream myself away

    do you feel meaning in life
    you've been silently screaming, I know
    now the twilight of evening is here
    and the day has left you feeling so low
