    the sunken ship, beneath the surface
    a relic of what used to be
    ensnared within this great solution
    a fragile droplet in the sea

    the sun king&#x27;s ship lies still before us
    its luster gone, washed out in time
    this shadow hiding in the moonlight
    the gleaming hope that once was mine

    do you
    feel
    blue, like we used to
    and do you
    expect that something will change without action

    you preach of rebellion, yet savour the peace
    while your body is ailing, you spread the disease
    you slander your purpose, you sacrifice friends
    still you try to go back on your words over and over again

    the moonlit goddess has abandoned the sky
    she has left all she knew, and is wondering why
    all the birds have stopped singing, the trees dropped their leaves
    why sun doesn&#x27;t rise at the dawn of the eve

    now the castle is empty, these dogs have no home
    could you give us some shelter, could you spare us some bones
    in this world where the people are ruled by the blind
    could you give us some faith, 
    could you spare us some eyes

    do you think
    we could be free
    from this strange
    melancholy
    do you think 
    something might change if I reach out and grab you

    oh, how we tremble, afraid of the fear
    or the warmth in my stomach whenever you&#x27;re near
    do you think we should change, do you think that we could 
    or has the sun king&#x27;s ship now departed for good
