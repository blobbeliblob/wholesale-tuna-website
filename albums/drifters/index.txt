e:T658,
    there's nothing here, of what has been
    the dust has covered everything
    this idol, once the pride of man
    the guardian of this desert land

    the remnants of a long gone past
    these cities weren't built to last
    they're slowly sinking in the sand
    the guardian makes her final stand

    the shadow of a closing storm
    we gather up, and then we're gone
    the memories we leave behind
    are droplets in the sea of time

    now hurry up, we've got to go
    we can't afford to take it slow
    so close your mouth, protect your eyes
    how long before you realise

    we're drifters pushing onwards
    in this landscape of decay
    just two lost souls moving forward
    live to breathe another day

    safe and sound, but where's our hope
    the space around us only slopes
    there's toxic, radioactive waste
    the feelings that we can't replace

    now hurry up, we've got to go
    escape this dream we can't let grow
    so close your eyes, open your mouth
    and take a look, erase your doubts

    we're drifters, pushing onwards
    trying to find our paradise
    just two lost souls moving forward
    while we lie here paralyzed

    now hurry up, we've got to go
    we can't afford to take it slow
    so close your mouth, protect your eyes
    how long before you realise

    we're drifters, pushing onwards
    trying to find our paradise
    just two lost souls moving forward
    while we lie here paralyzed

    we're drifters, pushing onwards
    through these shades of washed out grey
    just two lost souls moving forward
    while we slowly drift away
    f:T6eb,
    Ooo, a aaa
    Ooo, a aaa
    Ooo, a aaa
    Ooo, a aaa

    I feel the walls closing in
    the orchestra is set to begin
    a symphony faintly heard on the wind

    how does the world around me appear to spin
    if I cannot move, can I ever win
    I throw my plastic life in the recycle bin

    somewhere, anywhere, 
    get me there, I don't care
    everywhere is in my head
    the moon above me turning red

    little flower in disguise
    feeling low when you are high
    trying to rationalize
    easy peasy medium size

    it's ecstasy
    ecstasy
    you know it's ecstasy
    e e e ecstasy

    are you free? (I don't know)
    reality (is creeping up)
    are you me? (I'm not sure)
    who do you want to be? (okay, now stop)

    do you dream? (I don't know)
    ecstasy (flows through my mind)
    can you see? (I have no eyes)
    what do you mean (I think I'm blind)

    it's ecstasy
    ecstasy
    you know it's ecstasy
    e e e ecstasy

    it's ecstasy (are you losing control)
    to anxiety (is life taking it's toll)
    do you feel relief (are you able to tell)
    have you found your peace (is it something you sell)

    now don't start thinking that you're just gonna die
    cause you have to keep on dreaming if you want to stay alive
    you know that fear is a friend that is telling the truth
    so when confronted by reality, what are you gonna do

    it's ecstasy (ecstasy, sodomy, lobotomy and anarchy)
    ecstasy (ecstasy, sodomy, lobotomy and anarchy)
    you know it's ecstasy (ecstasy, sodomy, lobotomy and anarchy)
    e e e ecstasy (ecstasy, sodomy, lobotomy and anarchy)

    I can't stop thinking of you
    I can't stop thinking of you
    I can't stop thinking of you
    I can't stop thinking of you

16:T52d,
    is this the dream you meant to lend me?
    this sour transition from your night to dawn
    I never thought of you as twisted
    but when you made us all your pawns

    I finally see the thorns you spoke of
    the agonizing pain you meant
    the darkness as the sun corroded
    this dream was not one to be lent

    but how can you pretend to love me
    when I don't even love myself
    I used to wish I was just like you
    but now I wish for someone else

    the day before the sun came crawling
    back into the chambers of an empty moon
    we sat back as the sky came falling
    downs from the mattress spread out with a plume

    we tried to map out all the unknowns
    in the calm before the beast awoke
    I thought this was the perfect headrest
    so soothing were the words you spoke

    so when you say you really love me
    as I hide behind this see-through shawl
    will you offer up your shoulder for me
    and can I let my feelings sprawl?

    and I've been thinking of a world
    where there's no sun
    a world without a surface where
    we fall, but never hit the ground

    and I've been having dreams
    I can't remember what they mean
    we run, we fall, we crawl, we stumble
    forward, forward and we scream

    I scream
    Icecream
    the summer's nearly here

17:T5b1,
    Anthony, the dragon
    was holed up in his cave
    he should have switched to normal
    but corruption took his save

    Anthony, the dragon
    did you hear about him too?
    lately he's been hooked on grass
    and all he says is moo

    anthony, the dragon
    no need to be so wary
    his arguments lack punch
    cause he just wants to be contrarian

    Anthony the dragon
    Can't stand his cockatoo
    She lives inside his eardrum
    And the rent is overdue

    Anthony, the dragon
    has barely left his home
    got stuck in conversation
    with his little garden gnomes

    Anthony the dragon
    Has lost his perfect pitch
    The cuckoo took it yesterday
    And now he claims it's his

    Anthony, the dragon
    Hey, have you seen his tail?
    He's tried to stop the jittering
    But oh, to no avail

    anthony, the dragon
    behold his powers gained
    went searching for secluded monks
    spent 15 years to train

    Anthony the dragon
    Is feeling ill at ease
    His cockatoo has flown away
    Across the seven seas

    anthony, the dragon
    his pride has made him vain
    pretending to be holy
    but his his shirt has got a stain

    Anthony, the dragon
    now has nothing left but fumes
    his claws can't rip, his fangs can't bite
    and he's addicted to legumes

    anthony, the dragon
    was used to being scary
    now his wings can't lift him anymore
    and he's no longer legendary
