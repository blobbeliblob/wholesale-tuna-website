3:T517,
    with the scenery passing by
    I have to change my point of view 
    laying down, see the planets fly
    so move over Satan, here I'm coming through 

    the light refracting telescope
    shows craters on the moon
    as Ganymede bears our hope
    in orbit, witches on their brooms

    Galileo Galilei
    through his window frame
    looked at the stars
    saw the milky way

    Galileo Galilei
    went against the faith
    waged a holy war
    and almost burned at the stake

    with the earth no longer steady
    at the center of the universe
    stand before the inquisition
    disprove the truth you've seen reversed

    as the world turns heliocentric
    set the stage up for astronomy
    are the pillars of creation
    nothing more than just a fantasy

    Galileo Galilei
    through his window frame
    looked at the stars
    saw the milky way

    Galileo Galilei
    went against the faith
    waged a holy war
    and almost burned at the stake

    Galileo Galilei
    through his window frame
    looked at the stars
    saw the milky way

    Galileo Galilei
    went against the faith
    waged a holy war
    and almost burned at the stake

    paa pa paa paa
    paa pa pa paa

    ga ga ga Galileo (Galileo Galilei)
    ga ga ga Galileo (Galileo Galilei)
    4:T6e7,
    take me in your time machine 
    to places where I've never been 
    the further we go
    the less we will know

    a dying world of suffering
    that's crumbling under foolish kings
    but buildings of gold
    stood no weight they could hold

    we set out on an epic quest
    to rid the world of all unrest
    we struck an accord
    I gave you my sword

    a pantheon of worship past
    an ancient scroll, a charm to cast
    to cull the weak minded
    and leave their souls branded

    shed away 
    the curse of the living 
    to become 
    yet another false god

    a twisted curse, a maiden fair
    a promise kept, an oath to share
    we sat round the table
    and weaved up the fables

    the silent words that leave no sound
    but crimson leaves upon the ground
    the prophecy foretold
    a new king on the throne

    bled away 
    the flesh they were given 
    as they found 
    you were naught but a fraud

    past the dragon's ascent
    when the hour drew near
    one last fleeting look back
    at all the things we held dear

    at the peak of the summit
    where the earth and sky meet
    as we braced for the battle
    and held strong our beliefs

    but as we laid in trenches 
    and we challenged the beast
    you were conveniently missing
    to partake in the feast

    now the lights in the castle
    and all the stars in the sky
    have faded to nothing
    as she says her goodbyes

    leave behind
    all those dreams and ambitions
    what a clown
    to have taken the throne

    in your mind
    you're fulfilling your vision
    while your hounds
    rip the skin off our bones

    to the blind
    all your sins are forgiven 
    claim your crown
    now you're king of the fools

11:T46a,
    have you seen the dogs of war
    stand atop that crested hill
    coming down, a thunderous plague
    we run for shelter, steel our will

    the dogs of war
    seize the day, and claim it all
    without cause
    hear the whistle, heed the call

    tearing through what lies before them
    desecrating holy ground
    leaving none within their wake
    none but these ferocious hounds

    the dogs of war
    giants that have learnt to fly
    spoil the land for years to come
    dragons that command the skies

    what they think, it doesn't matter
    serve their head up on a platter
    blood and dirt, the gold they hoard
    they feed the wallet of their lord

    addicts of the holy water
    preach their faith, there is no other
    harvest children, ripe for slaughter
    milk the sons and sell the daughters

    for the people's satisfaction
    consequences of their actions
    never practice what they preach
    their happiness stays out of reach

    march themselves into the grave
    existence is nothing but torture
    all the people they won't save
    money talks, soldiers of fortune

12:T60a,
    the scene before us, mud and grey
    lit up by flames and clear as day
    the biting cold, our frozen breaths
    what lingers here, the scent of death

    all around us 
    our brethren die
    eyes focused forward
    we hear their cries

    can't you see it's suicidal
    passing through the woods at night
    but as of now, it's pure survival
    stray the path and pay the price

    we sought to revive our greatness gone
    when evil arrived, we opened the door
    it indulged in our primal fears
    we pushed out brothers, far and near

    abandon all hope
    desert the fight
    for here before us
    unbudging might

    can't you see it's suicidal
    passing through the woods at night
    but as of now, it's pure survival
    stray the path and pay the price

    fighting 'til the last drop
    even though we know
    they sacrificed us
    just as we were told
    by our messiah
    never did we question
    how the fool
    somehow got us here
    now everything we knew is 
    swallowed by fire

    and on my mother's grave
    I swear that we look just the same
    still here we are 
    ordered to kill each other 
    I'll die a slave, a martyr not
    an unmarked stone, that's soon forgot
    while Ozymandias memory fades out
    buried in the sand

    fighting 'til the last drop
    even though we know
    they sacrificed us
    just as we were told
    by our messiah
    never did we question
    how the fool
    somehow got us here
    now everything we knew is

13:T4dd,
    the day I learnt about the bomb
    a ripple in the plastic sea
    a tower on a field of rooks
    that could distort reality

    my mother took me to the shrine
    to glance upon the sacred metal
    within the sheltered concrete cave
    a garden full of poison petals

    the dream snatchers
    have come for me
    they want to take
    my liberty

    the howling of a distant scream
    a spreading silence filled with tension
    slipping through the growing cracks
    a peace without renewed extension

    the dust that took my brother's lungs
    the smatter of the scorching rain
    I peeked out from my hiding spot
    the city, now a sea of flames

    the dream snatchers
    they will survive
    they left us here
    to burn alive

    we struggled to confront the weight
    of everything that's come to pass
    remembering the better days
    without this choking toxic gas

    the crops that perished on the fields
    the sun that ripped with burning claws
    this frightful power that we wielded
    left us blind to our own flaws

    dream snatchers
    what can we do
    when noone's left
    but just us two

    the dream snatchers
    are we the same
    to close our eyes
    and shift the blame

14:T5bc,
    take me
    to the edges of the world
    take me
    into the embrace of that girl
    take me
    where the flowers have no name
    la la la la la la la la la

    wake me
    from this fondness that I've grown
