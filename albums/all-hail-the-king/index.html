    desire
    little kids are caught in the crossfire
    people conflate the want to possess
    with sense of belonging, want to impress

    out in the jungle
    out on the streets
    people struggling
    to stay on their feet

    as they stumble
    walls abrasive
    concrete jungle
    urban natives

    time
    constantly craving the lime
    living your prime it&#x27;s so sour
    ageing three years by the hour

    morning news
    crimes of hate
    small decisions
    carry weight

    pillars crumble
    heroes fall

    shows craters on the moon
    as Ganymede bears our hope
    in orbit, witches on their brooms

    through his window frame
    looked at the stars
    saw the milky way

    Galileo Galilei
    went against the faith
    waged a holy war

    with the earth no longer steady
    at the center of the universe
    stand before the inquisition
    disprove the truth you&#x27;ve seen reversed

    as the world turns heliocentric
    set the stage up for astronomy

    take me in your time machine 
    to places where I&#x27;ve never been 
    the further we go
    the less we will know

    a dying world of suffering
    that&#x27;s crumbling under foolish kings
    but buildings of gold
    stood no weight they could hold

    we set out on an epic quest
    to rid the world of all unrest
    we struck an accord
    I gave you my sword

    a pantheon of worship past
    an ancient scroll, a charm to cast
    to cull the weak minded
    and leave their souls branded

    shed away 
    the curse of the living 
    to become 
    yet another false god

    a twisted curse, a maiden fair
    a promise kept, an oath to share
    we sat round the table
    and weaved up the fables

    the silent words that leave no sound
    but crimson leaves upon the ground
    the prophecy foretold
    a new king on the throne

    bled away 
    the flesh they were given 
    as they found 
    you were naught but a fraud

    past the dragon&#x27;s ascent
    when the hour drew near
    one last fleeting look back
    at all the things we held dear

    at the peak of the summit
    where the earth and sky meet
    as we braced for the battle
    and held strong our beliefs

    but as we laid in trenches 
    and we challenged the beast
    you were conveniently missing
    to partake in the feast

    now the lights in the castle
    and all the stars in the sky
    have faded to nothing
    as she says her goodbyes

    leave behind
    all those dreams and ambitions
    what a clown
    to have taken the throne

    in your mind
    you&#x27;re fulfilling your vision
    while your hounds
    rip the skin off our bones

    to the blind
    all your sins are forgiven 
    claim your crown
    now you&#x27;re king of the fools

    have you seen the dogs of war
    stand atop that crested hill
    coming down, a thunderous plague
    we run for shelter, steel our will

    the dogs of war
    seize the day, and claim it all
    without cause
    hear the whistle, heed the call

    tearing through what lies before them
    desecrating holy ground
    leaving none within their wake
    none but these ferocious hounds

    the dogs of war
    giants that have learnt to fly
    spoil the land for years to come
    dragons that command the skies

    what they think, it doesn&#x27;t matter
    serve their head up on a platter
    blood and dirt, the gold they hoard
    they feed the wallet of their lord

    addicts of the holy water
    preach their faith, there is no other
    harvest children, ripe for slaughter
    milk the sons and sell the daughters

    for the people&#x27;s satisfaction
    consequences of their actions
    never practice what they preach
    their happiness stays out of reach

    march themselves into the grave
    existence is nothing but torture
    all the people they won&#x27;t save
    money talks, soldiers of fortune

    eyes focused forward

    stray the path and pay the price

    we sought to revive our greatness gone
    when evil arrived, we opened the door
    it indulged in our primal fears
    we pushed out brothers, far and near

    just as we were told

    never did we question

    and on my mother&#x27;s grave
    I swear that we look just the same
    still here we are 
    ordered to kill each other 
    I&#x27;ll die a slave, a martyr not
    an unmarked stone, that&#x27;s soon forgot
    while Ozymandias memory fades out
    buried in the sand

    the day I learnt about the bomb
    a ripple in the plastic sea
    a tower on a field of rooks
    that could distort reality

    my mother took me to the shrine
    to glance upon the sacred metal
    within the sheltered concrete cave
    a garden full of poison petals

    the dream snatchers
    have come for me
    they want to take
    my liberty

    the howling of a distant scream
    a spreading silence filled with tension
    slipping through the growing cracks
    a peace without renewed extension

    the dust that took my brother&#x27;s lungs
    the smatter of the scorching rain
    I peeked out from my hiding spot
    the city, now a sea of flames

    the dream snatchers
    they will survive
    they left us here
    to burn alive

    we struggled to confront the weight
    of everything that&#x27;s come to pass
    remembering the better days
    without this choking toxic gas

    the crops that perished on the fields
    the sun that ripped with burning claws
    this frightful power that we wielded
    left us blind to our own flaws

    dream snatchers
    what can we do
    when noone&#x27;s left
    but just us two

    the dream snatchers
    are we the same
    to close our eyes
