3:T44e,
    Leave your cat, let's go to heaven
    dying is a cheap expense
    on the way let's grab a sandwich
    oh, by the way, we'll pass through hell

    grab your hat, and let's get going
    tuna should be fine, or steak
    Wednesday's got this air around her, 
    let's not linger, take-away

    down and down this spiral staircase
    if you trip, it's quite a drop
    mountains built of human waste
    first the bottom, then the top

    as we push on through the barley
    cutting seaweed as we plough
    hollow mortals reach their arms out
    once they grab you they won't let go

    further down the road to nowhere
    holy beings spread their wings
    servants of the master only
    at the end the bell will ring

    down and down this dreadful dreamland
    climbing up will not be fun
    as the sand that dries your eyeballs
    cut the cord and end the run

    the master's words rumble as lightning and thunder
    his minions they dance as the world's going under
    the angels have standards, they only do tango
    the demons don't care as they waltz this fandango
    4:T5ab,
    everybody's gathered
    cause rumor's gone around 
    tonight behind the old chapel
    there's something going down

    a virgin to be sacrificed
    the holiest of meat
    we stain our hands to clean our sin
    our savior we must greet

    and can you feel my heartbeat, Luna
    as you watch me from above
    I drive the stake through innocence
    all in the name of love

    the minister seeks legal advice
    to justify his spiritual lies
    they go against the words of faith
    he knows the hour's running late

    the beast, it must be satisfied
    it's thirst be quelched again
    our fear has won, all hope is lost
    the hero must be slain

    so can you feel my heartbeat, Luna
    I try to feed this twisted love
    it's blasphemy, this deed we've done
    to satiate our thirst for blood

    and through the mist, a shadow vague
    the prince of darkness risen has
    his chains undone, his shackles torn
    our overlord is here, at last

    the demons flood in through the gates
    as evil swallows all men brave
    our lord leans forward, bares his fangs
    and whispers, "yo, I'm Dave"

    now can you feel my heartbeat, Luna
    I cry out for your name in vain
    the moon has left, abandoned us
    our souls uncleansed, drenched in the rain

    so can you feel my heartbeat, Luna
    I try to find your pulse again
    while demons nibble on my flesh
    your lifeless corpse, my endless pain

a:T6c5,
    today, I choked myself
    until I couldn't breathe
    I threw up on the kitchen floor
    and cried myself to sleep

    the oxygen escaped my lungs
    the vacuum blew up in my mind
    the things I did not want to see
    the things I won't see when I'm blind

    and what you hide
    and what you fear
    is what I like
    but it was not part of the deal

    oh
    I'd like to know
    oh oh oh

    how many more hours
    how many more days
    how many more nights
    with my heart set ablaze

    this damp, dripping dungeon
    this winding, long maze
    these thoughts without matter
    this glimmering haze

    I opened up a window
    to let the air clear up my head
    to dilute this poignant stench
    from the carcass lying in my bed

    my brain had leaked out through my nose
    my eye-balls popped like a balloon
    my chest, torn open from inside
    my soul departed to the moon

    and what you hide
    and what you fear
    is what I like
    but it was not part of the deal

    oh
    I'd like to know
    oh oh oh

    how many more hours
    how many more days
    how many more nights
    with my heart set ablaze

    this damp, dripping dungeon
    this winding, long maze
    these thoughts without matter
    this glimmering haze

    how many more hours
    how many more days
    how many more nights
    with my heart set ablaze

    this damp, dripping dungeon
    this winding, long maze
    these thoughts without matter
    this glimmering haze

    the dream that eludes me
    and the fear without end
    have colluded together
    and I see them as friends

    I used to feel empty
    now I long for some space
    but I am no angel
    and my fall has no grace
