3:T4a2,
    un suspiro, una vida
    y los sueños del ayer
    diluidos lentamente
    en la sombra del placer

    tan hermosa, tan herida, 
    tan perdida en el presente
    no se siente comprendida
    estos sueños no son suficientes

    este color que encuentro en ti
    este nuevo medio en el que intento existir
    el dolor que dejaste estacado en mi
    es que sin ti ya no siento que puedo vivir

    hipócrita, consumida
    por el gusto de tener
    desechable subconsciente
    sin lugar al cual volver

    si se siente deprimida
    por las causas del ambiente
    enfrentada ante la amenaza
    de un planeta mas caliente

    este amor que sembraste en mi
    esta costumbre a la que me intento submitir
    esta flor que creció de mi memoria de ti
    y siento nuevas emociones que quiero, quiero descubrir

    este color que encuentro en ti
    este nuevo medio en el que intento existir
    el dolor que dejaste estacado en mi
    es que sin ti ya no siento que puedo vivir

    este amor que sembraste en mi
    esta costumbre a la que me intento submitir
    esta flor que creció de mi memoria de ti
    y siento nuevas emociones que quiero, quiero descubrir
    4:T41f,
    if the bombs were dropped tomorrow
    would the songs I wrote remain
    would someone be there to sing them
    could they plant a seed for change

    once the thunder gods have settled
    silence spread across the lands
    could we shape a new beginning
    with the world placed in our hands

    could we lie down on the grass
    admire a sky sprinkled with stars
    on a canvas painted crimson
    lifeless fields tainted by wars

    could we find a sense of reason
    have we lost the gift of choice
    would I be able to find you
    just by following your voice

    could we hear the sound of children
    would they be a source of laughter
    on the pastures of our fathers
    could we stay forever after

    what does it mean to be alive
    we try to hide behind our smiles
    this hole within us, filled with screams
    the price we paid to reach our dreams

    and if the bombs were dropped tomorrow
    would we leave behind a past
    or would the fields be filled with flowers
    all these dreams that never were

b:T5e7,
    what the hell is going on, man
    forests are becoming stoneland
    corporates are cutting down the trees
    pesticides are killing all the bees

    blame it on the meat production
    and don't forget our reproduction
    voting for the mass seduction
    lose your rights for tax reductions

    spray me with that sweet DDT
    as we flush all of our microplastics
    into the sea

    cold is spreading, evil plants its seed
    ignorance as mother Earth will bleed
    fear of safety, hanging on to greed
    monetize on basic human needs

    we consume, we sell our souls
    we like to be under control
    we choose to do as we are told
    we sit back, watch our lives unfold

    shower me in sweet DNA
    as your gene manipulated organs
    are shipped away

    poison leaching through the soil
    we're stuck inside this mortal coil
    high on mental masturbation
    self destruct in desperation

    television melts our brain
    corruption sips into the grains
    medication numbs the pain
    our psychic powers keep us sane

    what the hell is going on, man
    something that I cannot understand
    we don't know how we should use the land
    planet Earth's slowly becoming bland

    close your eyes and count to ten
    now open them and try again
    fate has lost its faith in you
    so what are we supposed to do

    what the hell is going on, man
    something that I cannot understand
    what the hell is going on, man
    try to fix it if you think you can

c:T60a,
    once again, the sky is crying
    tears replaced by acid sweat
    warming up and slowly dying
    creeping up, this silent threat

    like methane bursting through the lakes
    and suffocating life
    the red pill that we did not take
    we're left here without ice

    glaciers drowning in the ocean
    man is selling them as lotion
    wildfires light up the night
    consumed as distant kilobytes

    the faster we fall
    the longer distance we must crawl
    covering our eyes
    will only further our demise

    the same mistakes we've done before
    our hearts will ache and be left sore
    we try to find our blessed relief
    escape within messed up beliefs

    through urban jungles, crouching tigers
    hidden dragons in disguise
    aliens like H R Giger's
    predators devouring life

    if ecstasy is what you seek
    employ the child, destroy the meek
    monetize procrastination
    live off nature's exploitation

    the end of peace, the start of war
    the smell of death like never before
    the valkyries, the heart of darkness
    the water's red in the age of madness

    the trees are marching to the sea
    the root of evil, all the bees
    are breathing in the pesticides
    forced to join our suicide

    the faster we fall
    the longer distance we must crawl
    covering our eyes
    will only further our demise

    the end of peace, the start of war
    the smell of death like never before
    the valkyries, the heart of darkness
    the water's red in the age of madness
