3:T532,
    I sit atop the watchtower
    the guardian of the gate
    but there's nothing to watch over
    I contemplate my fate

    awoken from eternal slumber
    eons after time was lost
    but eons are just larger numbers
    and so I stay here on this post

    I
    have
    something
    that I'd like to find

    let me be
    warden of the land
    set me free
    is this my chance

    let me stay
    so I can understand
    cause now I have
    the whole world in my hand

    silent streets and empty casas
    ancient cities overgrown
    strolling through deserted plazas
    where forgotten kings were overthrown

    summoned from uncharted depths
    astral planes not yet explored
    mindscapes where the old ones slept
    hidden in folklore

    I
    have
    something
    that I'd like to find

    let me be
    warden of the land
    set me free
    is this my chance

    let me stay
    so I can understand
    cause now I have
    the whole world in my hand

    let me be
    warden of the land
    set me free
    is this my chance

    let me stay
    so I can understand
    cause now I have
    the whole world in my hand

    let me be
    warden of the land
    set me free
    is this my chance

    let me stay
    so I can understand
    cause now I have
    the whole world in my hand
    4:T538,
    if tentacles are fiction
    then what the hell am I
    pushing on without conviction
    a wet and squishy breathing lie
    hide yourself inside old books
    rewriting history
    imagination changed your looks
    it twists and turns reality

    take me back
    to the time before land
    the happy days
    when squid ruled over man
    if everything
    came from the sea
    before it warmed up
    a few degrees

    if tentacles are fiction
    what am I doing here
    existing as a contradiction
    as muddy water is unclear
    will you end caught up on the hook
    inviting destiny
    growing softer as you cook
    your new reality

    take me back
    to the time before land
    the happy days
    when squid ruled over man
    if everything
    came from the sea
    before it warmed up
    a few degrees

    now back we go
    below the waves
    to find the freedom
    that we crave
    tentacles
    served on a plate
    is not our choice
    is not our fate

    take me back
    to the time before land
    the happy days
    when squid ruled over man
    if everything
    came from the sea
    before it warmed up
    a few degrees

    now back we go
    below the waves
    to find the freedom
    that we crave
    tentacles
    served on a plate
    is not our choice
    is not our fate
