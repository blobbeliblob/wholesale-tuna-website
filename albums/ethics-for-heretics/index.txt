e:T46a,
    have you seen the dogs of war
    stand atop that crested hill
    coming down, a thunderous plague
    we run for shelter, steel our will

    the dogs of war
    seize the day, and claim it all
    without cause
    hear the whistle, heed the call

    tearing through what lies before them
    desecrating holy ground
    leaving none within their wake
    none but these ferocious hounds

    the dogs of war
    giants that have learnt to fly
    spoil the land for years to come
    dragons that command the skies

    what they think, it doesn't matter
    serve their head up on a platter
    blood and dirt, the gold they hoard
    they feed the wallet of their lord

    addicts of the holy water
    preach their faith, there is no other
    harvest children, ripe for slaughter
    milk the sons and sell the daughters

    for the people's satisfaction
    consequences of their actions
    never practice what they preach
    their happiness stays out of reach

    march themselves into the grave
    existence is nothing but torture
    all the people they won't save
    money talks, soldiers of fortune
    f:T4b2,
    have you come to see the flowers
    in our garden of despair
    here with us, there's only cowards
    too afraid to take the leap

    stay with me, I'll show you powers
    you could figure out your flairs
    so stick around for just two hours
    we can take you anywhere

    and though we can no longer dream 
    I can't distinguish fantasy
    from what is real
    and what I feel
    is this the dream
    you left for me to see

    the garden of forbidden tastes
    a place my eyes yet hadn't gazed
    with kindred spirits 'round the pyre
    lonely hearts filled with desire

    but when I came, I stood unfazed
    I watched the flames light up this place 
    and as it bordered on disorder
    reason fled, I shook my head

    and as we drift into
    another dream, with just us two
    I turn to you, and as I fall
    into your arms, you tell me
    everything you said to me 
    was true

    now have you come to see the flowers
    in our garden of despair
    once sweet honey now tastes sour
    poison petals in the air

    waiting for the final hour
    in full bloom, I'll meet you there
    twenty four, the world devourer
    slumbers deep inside its lair

15:T7e7,
    if I was a tomato
    on my way across the sky
    laying on a mountaintop
    and looking at the clouds
    then how am I to reach this fleeting
    dream of solitude
    when every cloud upon the sky
    reminds me of you

    a faint red shimmer in the darkness
    led us to the fireflies
    the pale blue glimmer of the future
    I saw dance across your eyes
    and though I sensed the ice beneath me crack
    then what was I to do
    when every thought inside my head
    revolved around you

    and so, you asked of me
    who would you like me to be
    I said, the moon and the stars
    and everything in between
    and then I asked of you
    what would you like me to do
    if I could be the sun
    would you then love me too

    but as the seasons slowly shifted
    and the wind began to change
    could we keep ourselves together
    if we couldn't remain friends
    with a chill that turned the weather
    winter knocked upon the door
    and then I realized that I would like 
    to strive for something more

    so when you asked of me
    who would you like me to be
    I said, the moon and the stars
    and everything in between
    and then I asked of you
    what would you like me to do
    if I could be the sun
    would you then love me too

    lost inside your gaze
    I'm drifting through the galaxies
    my body, soul and mind
    are drawn in by your gravity
    slowly orbiting
    around your singularity
    I stop to contemplate the past
    the future and the in between

    and so, you asked of me
    who would you like me to be
    I said, the moon and the stars
    and everything in between
    and then I asked of you
    what would you like me to do
    if I could be the sun
    would you then love me too

    and so, you asked of me
    who would you like me to be
    I said, the moon and the stars
    and everything in between
    and then I asked of you
    what would you like me to do
    if I could be the sun
    would you then love me too
