    desire
    little kids are caught in the crossfire
    people conflate the want to possess
    with sense of belonging, want to impress

    out in the jungle
    out on the streets
    people struggling
    to stay on their feet

    as they stumble
    walls abrasive
    concrete jungle
    urban natives

    time
    constantly craving the lime
    living your prime it's so sour
    ageing three years by the hour

    morning news
    crimes of hate
    small decisions
    carry weight

    pillars crumble
    heroes fall
    concrete jungle
    swallows all

    with the scenery passing by
    I have to change my point of view 
    laying down, see the planets fly
    so move over Satan, here I'm coming through 

    the light refracting telescope
    shows craters on the moon
    as Ganymede bears our hope
    in orbit, witches on their brooms

    Galileo Galilei
    through his window frame
    looked at the stars
    saw the milky way

    Galileo Galilei
    went against the faith
    waged a holy war
    and almost burned at the stake

    with the earth no longer steady
    at the center of the universe
    stand before the inquisition
    disprove the truth you've seen reversed

    as the world turns heliocentric
    set the stage up for astronomy
    are the pillars of creation
    nothing more than just a fantasy

    Galileo Galilei
    through his window frame
    looked at the stars
    saw the milky way

    Galileo Galilei
    went against the faith
    waged a holy war
    and almost burned at the stake

    Galileo Galilei
    through his window frame
    looked at the stars

    waged a holy war

    take me in your time machine 
    to places where I've never been 
    the further we go
    the less we will know

    a dying world of suffering
    that's crumbling under foolish kings
    but buildings of gold
    stood no weight they could hold

    we set out on an epic quest
    to rid the world of all unrest
    we struck an accord
    I gave you my sword

    a pantheon of worship past
    an ancient scroll, a charm to cast
    to cull the weak minded
    and leave their souls branded

    shed away 
    the curse of the living 
    to become 
    yet another false god

    a twisted curse, a maiden fair
    a promise kept, an oath to share
    we sat round the table
    and weaved up the fables

    the silent words that leave no sound
    but crimson leaves upon the ground
    the prophecy foretold
    a new king on the throne

    bled away 
    the flesh they were given 
    as they found 
    you were naught but a fraud

    past the dragon's ascent
    when the hour drew near
    one last fleeting look back
    at all the things we held dear

    at the peak of the summit
    where the earth and sky meet
    as we braced for the battle
    and held strong our beliefs

    but as we laid in trenches 
    and we challenged the beast
    you were conveniently missing
    to partake in the feast

    now the lights in the castle
    and all the stars in the sky
    have faded to nothing
    as she says her goodbyes

    leave behind
    all those dreams and ambitions
    what a clown
    to have taken the throne

    in your mind
    you're fulfilling your vision
    while your hounds
    rip the skin off our bones

    to the blind
    all your sins are forgiven 
    claim your crown

  "dogs-of-war": 
    `
    have you seen the dogs of war
    stand atop that crested hill
    coming down, a thunderous plague
    we run for shelter, steel our will

    the dogs of war
    seize the day, and claim it all
    without cause
    hear the whistle, heed the call

    tearing through what lies before them
    desecrating holy ground
    leaving none within their wake
    none but these ferocious hounds

    the dogs of war
    giants that have learnt to fly
    spoil the land for years to come
    dragons that command the skies

    what they think, it doesn't matter
    serve their head up on a platter
    blood and dirt, the gold they hoard
    they feed the wallet of their lord

    addicts of the holy water
    preach their faith, there is no other
    harvest children, ripe for slaughter
    milk the sons and sell the daughters

    for the people's satisfaction
    consequences of their actions
    never practice what they preach
    their happiness stays out of reach

    march themselves into the grave
    existence is nothing but torture
    all the people they won't save
    money talks, soldiers of fortune

  "ozymandias":

    the scene before us, mud and grey
    lit up by flames and clear as day
    the biting cold, our frozen breaths
    what lingers here, the scent of death

    all around us 
    our brethren die
    eyes focused forward
    we hear their cries

    can't you see it's suicidal
    passing through the woods at night
    but as of now, it's pure survival
    stray the path and pay the price

    we sought to revive our greatness gone
    when evil arrived, we opened the door
    it indulged in our primal fears
    we pushed out brothers, far and near

    abandon all hope
    desert the fight
    for here before us
    unbudging might

    can't you see it's suicidal
    passing through the woods at night
    but as of now, it's pure survival
    stray the path and pay the price

    fighting 'til the last drop
    even though we know
    they sacrificed us
    just as we were told
    by our messiah
    never did we question
    how the fool
    somehow got us here
    now everything we knew is 
    swallowed by fire

    and on my mother's grave
    I swear that we look just the same
    still here we are 
    ordered to kill each other 
    I'll die a slave, a martyr not
    an unmarked stone, that's soon forgot
    while Ozymandias memory fades out
    buried in the sand

    fighting 'til the last drop
    even though we know
    they sacrificed us
    just as we were told
    by our messiah
    never did we question
    how the fool

    `
    the day I learnt about the bomb
    a ripple in the plastic sea
    a tower on a field of rooks
    that could distort reality

    my mother took me to the shrine
    to glance upon the sacred metal
    within the sheltered concrete cave
    a garden full of poison petals

    the dream snatchers
    have come for me
    they want to take
    my liberty

    the howling of a distant scream
    a spreading silence filled with tension
    slipping through the growing cracks
    a peace without renewed extension

    the dust that took my brother's lungs
    the smatter of the scorching rain
    I peeked out from my hiding spot
    the city, now a sea of flames

    the dream snatchers
    they will survive
    they left us here
    to burn alive

    we struggled to confront the weight
    of everything that's come to pass
    remembering the better days
    without this choking toxic gas

    the crops that perished on the fields
    the sun that ripped with burning claws
    this frightful power that we wielded
    left us blind to our own flaws

    dream snatchers
    what can we do
    when noone's left
    but just us two

    the dream snatchers
    are we the same
    to close our eyes

    into your arms, you tell me
    everything you said to me 
    was true

    if I was a tomato
    on my way across the sky
    laying on a mountaintop
    and looking at the clouds
    then how am I to reach this fleeting
    dream of solitude
    when every cloud upon the sky
    reminds me of you

    a faint red shimmer in the darkness
    led us to the fireflies
    the pale blue glimmer of the future

    then what was I to do

    what would you like me to do
    if I could be the sun
    would you then love me too

    but as the seasons slowly shifted
    and the wind began to change
    could we keep ourselves together
    if we couldn't remain friends
    with a chill that turned the weather
    winter knocked upon the door
    and then I realized that I would like 
    to strive for something more

    so when you asked of me
    who would you like me to be

    if I could be the sun

    lost inside your gaze
    I'm drifting through the galaxies
    my body, soul and mind
    are drawn in by your gravity
    slowly orbiting
    around your singularity
    I stop to contemplate the past
    the future and the in between

    eons after time was lost
    but eons are just larger numbers
    and so I stay here on this post

    I
    have
    something
    that I'd like to find

    let me be
    warden of the land
    set me free
    is this my chance

    let me stay
    so I can understand
    cause now I have
    the whole world in my hand

    silent streets and empty casas
    ancient cities overgrown
    strolling through deserted plazas
    where forgotten kings were overthrown

    summoned from uncharted depths
    astral planes not yet explored
    mindscapes where the old ones slept
    hidden in folklore

    I
    have
    something
    that I'd like to find

    let me be
    warden of the land
    set me free

    the prince of darkness risen has
    his chains undone, his shackles torn
    our overlord is here, at last

    the demons flood in through the gates
    as evil swallows all men brave
    our lord leans forward, bares his fangs
    and whispers, "yo, I'm Dave"

    now can you feel my heartbeat, Luna
    I cry out for your name in vain
    the moon has left, abandoned us
    our souls uncleansed, drenched in the rain

    fallen angel
    thrown away its grace
    a child of darkness
    swallowed by the moon's embrace

    creeping shadows
    in the flickering light
    twinkle twinkle
    through this endless night

    and in my room
    I've put up all these walls
    I focus on the problems
    I never had at all

    and over here
    I wish I'd disappear
    from the world outside
    just leave it all behind
    and all my fear
    and all these missing tears
    that hide inside
    they'll just erase my mind

    I know
    the truth that is concealed
    a cloud upon a clear red sky
    the doors that hide the deal

    artificial monster
    that awakens from its cryostasis
    leaving nothing in its wake
    it torments only my disgraces

    and over here
    I wish I'd disappear
    from the world outside
    just leave it all behind
    and all my fear

    stale grown relations

    and the spring of tomorrow

    an obscured reflection

    an unhealthy obsession

    sometimes when I'm feeling low
    I drift along the undertow
    flowing further down the stream

    still water depression
    on the verge of drying out
    salted words, sweetened tears
    without reason, beyond doubt

    linear regression
    pretty clear but quite unknown

    the origin of her pain

    she doesn't feel regret

    the sunken ship, beneath the surface
    a relic of what used to be
    ensnared within this great solution
    a fragile droplet in the sea

    the sun king's ship lies still before us
    its luster gone, washed out in time
    this shadow hiding in the moonlight
    the gleaming hope that once was mine

    do you
    feel
    blue, like we used to
    and do you
    expect that something will change without action

    you preach of rebellion, yet savour the peace
    while your body is ailing, you spread the disease
    you slander your purpose, you sacrifice friends
    still you try to go back on your words over and over again

    the moonlit goddess has abandoned the sky
    she has left all she knew, and is wondering why
    all the birds have stopped singing, the trees dropped their leaves
    why sun doesn't rise at the dawn of the eve

    now the castle is empty, these dogs have no home
    could you give us some shelter, could you spare us some bones
    in this world where the people are ruled by the blind
    could you give us some faith, 
    could you spare us some eyes

    do you think
    we could be free
    from this strange
    melancholy
    do you think 
    something might change if I reach out and grab you

    oh, how we tremble, afraid of the fear
    or the warmth in my stomach whenever you're near
    do you think we should change, do you think that we could 
    or has the sun king's ship now departed for good

    I don't want to be another sun among the stars

    if I go to sleep tomorrow, will I wake up yesterday
    if I follow all the signs, can I still be led astray
